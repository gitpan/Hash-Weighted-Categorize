Hash::Weighted::Categorize

DESCRIPTION

Hash::Weighted::Categorize is a tool to easily create scoring functions
(think monitoring) based on a simple mini-language. A
Hash::Weighted::Categorize object is a parser for this mini-language,
that will return coderefs implementing a scoring function written in
this language.

DOMAIN SPECIFIC LANGUAGE

The *domain specific language* parsed by Hash::Weighted::Categorize is
intentionnaly very simple.

Here is an example:

    %OK > 90%, %CRIT < .1: OK;
    %CRIT > 50%: CRIT;
    %CRIT > 25%: WARN;
    UNKN;
