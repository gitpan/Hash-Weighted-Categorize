=head1 NAME

Hash::Weighted::Categorize - Categorize weighted hashes using a Domain Specific Language

=head1 VERSION

version 0.001

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    # create a parser
    my $parser = Hash::Weighted::Categorize->new(
        input   => [qw( OK WARN CRIT UNKN )],
        default => 'OK',
        strict => 1,    # die when the hash contains unknown status names
    );

    # generate a scoring function
    my $score = $parser->parse( << 'CODE' );
    %OK > 90%, %CRIT < .1: OK;
    %CRIT > 50%: CRIT;
    %CRIT > 25%: WARN;
    UNKN;
    CODE

    # OK
    $status = $score->( { OK => 19, CRIT => 2 } );

    # WARN
    $status = $score->( { OK => 14, CRIT => 6, WARN => 1 } );

    # CRIT
    $status = $score->( { OK => 8, CRIT => 11, WARN => 1, UNKN => 1 } );

    # UNKN
    $status = $score->( { OK => 18, CRIT => 2, WARN => 1 } );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Hash::Weighted::Categorize is a tool to easily create scoring functions (think monitoring)
based on a simple mini-language. A Hash::Weighted::Categorize object is a parser for this
mini-language, that will return coderefs implementing a scoring function
written in this language.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new()

Create a new L<Hash::Weighted::Categorize> object.

=head2 parse( $code )

Parse the content of C<$code> and return the corresponding code reference.

=head2 parse_to_source( $code )

Parse the content of C<$code> and return the Perl source code for the
code reference that would be returned by C<parse()>.

=head1 DOMAIN SPECIFIC LANGUAGE

The I<domain specific language> parsed by L<Hash::Weighted::Categorize>
is intentionaly very simple. Simple statements consist of boolean
expressions separated by commas (C<,> meaning I<logical AND>), and
terminated by a colon (C<:>) followed by the result to be returned if
the condition is true.

In the following example:

    %OK > 90%, %CRIT < .1: OK;
    %CRIT > 50%: CRIT;
    %CRIT > 25%: WARN;
    UNKN;

C<OK>, C<WARN>, C<CRIT> and C<UNKN> are I<names>. On the left-hand side of
the C<:>, they are interpreted in relation to the keys of the examined
hash. A I<name> by itself is interpreted as the count/weight of this
element in the hash. When prefixed by a C<%> sign, the ratio of this
category compared to the total is used in the expression.

A literal number followed by a C<%> sign is simply divided by C<100>.

The currently supported mathematical operators are:
C<+>, C<->, C<*> and C</>.

The currently suppored comparison operators are:
C<< < >>, C<< <= >>, C<==>, C<< > >> and C<< >= >>.
